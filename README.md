MONK Python project
=======================

Margin-based Object Network Kit (MONK) is a distributed interactive machine learning platform.

It will support:
1. Featurization
- Distributed feature extraction
- NLP pipeline with NLTK (optional)
- OpenCV pipeline with pycv (optional)
2. Classification and regression
- L2 and L1 regularization
- Continuous ADMM for distributed continuous optimization
- Active learning
- Personalization
3. Recommendation with exploration
- Contextual-based recommendation
- Bandit for exploration
- Different cost function
4. Structured prediction
- Automatic or manual structure learning to improve indexing for faster inference
- Learning reduction to improve the accuracy
